BzWorkbench Bug List

This is in no way a complete list of bugs:

FIXME - loading in a smaller world and then loading in a world that is 
larger in size the ground does not resize onscreen to the correct larger size. open world 
config and bumping the size will fix the ground rendering.

FIXME - when saving material references, need to make sure materials that 
reference other materials are saved below those it references - sort material saves

CRASH - open H2O-R1.bzw, select a group (was a group containing a mesh), 
copy the group, create a new map and then paste goes bomb!

FIXME - arcs do not appear to be correctly built, this is very noticable when you 
compare a rotated arc in bzflag and then bzworkbench, load the Desert War map for example

FIXME - sphere texture coordinents are wrong on the top and bottom

FIXME - all object do not have normals, except for loaded meshes that have normals defined in the bzw file

FIXME - lighting: fix/add normals to ALL models first!
