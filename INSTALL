BZWorkbench Installation Notes
------------------------------

Compiling and Installation
==========================

To compile BZWorkbench, the following steps should get you up and
running quickly if everything external to BZWorkbench is properly
installed:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    src/bzworkbench

Aside from usual dependency on a GNU build environment, BZWorkbench has 
the following library and source dependencies:

	(*)	FLTK 1.1.7
	(*)	OpenSceneGraph 2.8
	(*)	OpenGL 1.4

On Fedora Linux a "yum install fltk-devel OpenSceneGraph-devel"
command will install the needed packages and their dependencies.

See the Readme.MSWindows for information on building on Windows.
